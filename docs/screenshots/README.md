# Screenshots placeholder instructions

This folder contains placeholder entries for Main UI screenshots used by `docs/main_ui_spec.md`.

Placeholder files:
- `main_overview.png` — recommended: full main screen overview (banner, drawer button, top categories)
- `category_expanded.png` — recommended: an expanded category showing the island rule and memo list

How to replace placeholders:
1. Capture screenshots on an emulator or device.
2. Resize to ~1200×800 (recommended) and use PNG format.
3. Save the files with the exact names above under `docs/screenshots/`.
4. Commit the images and update `docs/main_ui_spec.md` captions if necessary.

Note: currently these are placeholders; add the real PNGs later.
